This experience taught   me the importance of discipline and starting somewhere in terms of work. My role involved working in the back of the house, which encompassed tasks such as washing dishes, cleaning the floor, boxing chicken, taking out the trash, and communicating with the front of the house to ensure successful order delivery.</p>
